        <h1 class = "title">My Story</h1> 
            <p>Since completion of my Bachelor of Science in Communicative Disorders degree, I have had the privilege of working primarily in the school sector, providing assessment and intervention support to children presenting with a variety of speech, language and literacy delays/disorders. </p>
            <p>In addition, I have had the fortunate experience of working at NONA Child Development Centre with preschoolers and in the private sector working primarily with pre-schoolers.</p>
            <p>I have a strong personal commitment to professional development and am continually seeking new and exciting learning opportunities.  Wondering about my background with a certain communication difference or disorder?  Feel free to contact me to discuss my education and experience, ask questions, or learn more about what I offer.</p>
