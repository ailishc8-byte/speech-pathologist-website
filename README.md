After starting Web Programming COSC 360 at UBCO I developed a website for Louise Crowne. I am proud of the work I put into this and the outcome.
However, that being said, it lacked the professionalism I wanted for the client. As a result, I developed a website using WordPress with a similar 
layout. 

WordPress was easy to navigate and very user friendly. The part I struggled with most, was publishing the website. What began as something simple 
turned into something more challenging. Because I have WordPress local, there were extra steps and plugins I had to implement to make the 
website active.

1. Summarize the wording in the homepage
2. Change the layout slightly for mobile use
